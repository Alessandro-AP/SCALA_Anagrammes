 *
 *  The number of words in the sentence and its anagrams does not have to correspond.
 *  For example, the sentence `List("I", "love", "you")` is an anagram of the sentence `List("You", "olive")`.
 *
 *  Also, two sentences with the same words but in a different order are considered two different anagrams.
 *  For example, sentences `List("You", "olive")` and `List("olive","you")` are different anagrams of
 *  `List("I", "love", "you")`.
 *
 *  Note: in case that the words of the sentence are in the dictionary, then the sentence is the anagram of itself,
 *  so it has to be returned in this list.
